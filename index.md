## TLDR
Fridge-Freshness-Keeper is a fridge managing and food tracking system. It consists of a Raspberry Pi mounted on the fridge, a mobile app installed on an Android device, and an Alexa Skill. Users will be able to look up and manage their fridge conten through the three aspects. 

## Motivation

As we have a tremendous amount of food being wasted on a daily basis, it is integral for us to stay vigilant and attentive to food’s shelf life in case they are discarded for food spoilage. To tackle the problem of food wastage and let people optimize their food utilization, we propose the Fridge-Freshness-Keeper: a smart IoT system that can track the shelf-life of foods stored in the fridge and alert users about expiring items. The prototype of our product is designed as an external device attached to the fridge door. In addition, a mobile app installed on users’ smartphones operates as a secondary platform for notifying users about expiration dates and food lookup. The two components share a database storing information about foods in the fridge. In addition, users can utilize an Alexa Skill to add new food items into the system. 


We believe our IoT system can make a large impact since a significant portion of food spoilage is because people are unaware of how much food they have bought from the market and their shelf life. Our IoT system will be valuable to many user groups beyond home fridge owners. Restaurant and other business managers may find it helpful to keep their refrigerated items from expiring and optimize their procurement planning. Underserved populations such as elderly people with developing dementia can benefit from this by sharing the fridge data with caregivers or other family members to ensure healthy food consumption.
